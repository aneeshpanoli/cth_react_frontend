### Local Development Usage

The node application here is driven by yarn and utilizes the scripts defined in package.json.  
We currently have 2 profiles to run on, development and production.  Below is the instructions 
on how to run either.

## Installing Dependencies with Yarn
We first must install all the node modules needed for this project.  To this run the following 
command at the root of the project directory.

```shell script

yarn install

```

## Running on Development
The following scripts below run the application on development profile.
```shell script

yarn start

# or to be explicit

yarn start dev

```

## Running on Production (Should not be done locally)
```shell script

yarn start prod

```
